The two insurance policies, Keahlian ADAC Plus and ERGO Schutzbriefversicherung, exhibit several key differences. 

Firstly, the contract titles themselves highlight a distinction in focus. Keahlian ADAC Plus, offered by ADAC Versicherung AG, emphasizes "Keahlian," suggesting a potential focus on expertise or skills. In contrast, ERGO Schutzbriefversicherung, provided by ERGO Versicherung AG, simply refers to "Schutzbriefversicherung," indicating a more general protection plan. 

Secondly, the parties involved differ.  Keahlian ADAC Plus involves ADAC eV and ADAC Versicherung AG, suggesting a collaborative effort between the General German Automobile Club and its insurance branch. ERGO Schutzbriefversicherung, on the other hand, involves ERGO Versicherung AG and the insured, highlighting a direct relationship between the insurance provider and the policyholder. 

Finally, the organization name further clarifies the provider. Keahlian ADAC Plus is offered by the General German Automobile Club eV (ADAC), signifying a direct link to the automobile club. ERGO Schutzbriefversicherung is provided by ERGO Versicherung AG, a stand-alone insurance company. 

In conclusion, while both policies offer insurance, the distinct contract titles, involved parties, and organizations indicate differing focuses and potential benefits. Keahlian ADAC Plus seems to emphasize expertise within a context related to the automobile club, while ERGO Schutzbriefversicherung offers a more generalized protection plan directly from an insurance company.
