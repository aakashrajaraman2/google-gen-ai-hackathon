The two insurance policies, "Keahlian ADAC Plus" offered by General German Automobile Club eV (ADAC) and "Versicherungsbedingungen MiD-Basis-Mitgliedschaft" offered by Mobil in Deutschland e.V., differ significantly in terms of their contract details.  

Firstly, the policies have different contract titles. "Keahlian ADAC Plus" suggests a more comprehensive or premium level of insurance coverage compared to "Versicherungsbedingungen MiD-Basis-Mitgliedschaft," which implies a basic or entry-level plan.  

Secondly, the organizations offering the policies are distinct. General German Automobile Club eV (ADAC) is a well-known automobile club in Germany, while Mobil in Deutschland e.V. focuses on mobility services. This difference might indicate a different target audience or a focus on specific services offered by each organization. 

Lastly, the availability of information regarding board members and contract date varies between the two policies. While the "Keahlian ADAC Plus" policy lists the board members of General German Automobile Club eV (ADAC), the "Versicherungsbedingungen MiD-Basis-Mitgliedschaft" policy doesn't provide this information. Similarly, the contract date is not available for either policy. 

In conclusion, these discrepancies highlight the different nature and scope of these insurance policies. Further analysis of the policy documents is necessary to identify the specific benefits and terms of each plan.
